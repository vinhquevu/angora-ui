# Angora UI

A user interface for the Angora job orchestration system written in React. Since Angora is written as a web API, we can write a web interface in any technology we wish. Angora comes with a minimal web interface written in Starlette and Jinja, however this is not considered an optimal solution in the world of web development. So instead we created a web interface using React. This interface contains a lot more features than the default Angora interface and reflects the power and flexiblity of utilizing web APIs.
